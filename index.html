          <h3>Sparkfun AVC contestants</h3><br />
          Here are a few of the contestants from Sparkfun's AVC (Autonomous Vehicle Challenge) from a
          couple of years ago. The event is pretty well run, interesting and fun to watch. The people
          who enter the contest are pretty imaginative and creative. There were UFOs, vehicles with
          a variety of humorous attachments (like the caterpiller to the left), balancing robots and
          some that defy description. There was even a full size SUV that managed to traverse the
          course with no one driving it.

                The SHARC (Smokey Hills Area Robot Club) entry above was an actual full size SUV that
                managed to complete the course with no one driving. The passengers you see in the
                front seat are just passengers. You can see their hands are being held out the window
                to show that they are not driving. The truck got to drive the course alone because
                they didn't want it to run over any of the regular size contestants. They were in a demonstration
                class so they did not compete with the other folks.<br /><br />

                 They even had flying robots that navigated a separate course on their own.
                 The 'bots had to drop a tennis ball at a target, fly around and over and
                 under some obsticals and fly through a ring near the finish line for some
                 extra points. Most of the entries were quad-rotors and hex rotors, but there
                 were a few helicopters and fixed wing craft. Most of the course was over water
                 so there was the extra danger of taking a swim.

                There were quite a few of these guys entered into the AVC. Some of them
                were suprisingly fast and agile. The most fun was when there were several
                entries set off at the same time and the collision avoidance was tested.
                There were actually several collisions, none resulting in any damage.
                Probably the most expensive ooops was when the Macbook Pro slid out of
                it's restraint and slid across the pavement for a few feet. The owner
                didn't seem too upset as the computer belonged to his girlfriend.
