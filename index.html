        <h3>Why use Lorem Ipsum Generator?<br></h3>
        When you construct a web design you are most likely to not have any content in the beginning. So for the first time you show your web design for your client it can be useful to have some text to show so your client can imagine how it will look like when it is finished. That is why you should use our Lorem Ipsum Generator to generate simple text to fill your projects with. We hope you enjoy it and find it useful!<br><br>
