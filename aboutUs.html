        <h3>WE DO GOOD</h3>
        <p>Nope, not a grammatical error. At Techtonic Group, we do good in our community by providing opportunities to unemployed
            and underemployed individuals. We focus on increasing these opportunities to women, people of color, youth, and
            veterans to enter the information technology workforce.</p>

        <h2>CLASSES</h2>
        <p>We have created several classes to help get you ready for our Department of Labor (DOL) approved apprenticeship program,
            or wherever you go next. Classes are free to those who qualify. Each 4-week, classroom-based program will help
            motivated individuals get skilled up for software development careers.</p>
